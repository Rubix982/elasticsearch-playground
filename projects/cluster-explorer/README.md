# Elasticsearch Cluster Explorer

A comprehensive learning project to understand Elasticsearch clusters in depth - their architecture, APIs, management, and performance characteristics.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you'll understand:

- **Cluster Architecture**: Nodes, roles, and cluster topology
- **Cluster APIs**: Health, stats, settings, and node management
- **Shard Management**: Allocation, rebalancing, and routing
- **Performance Monitoring**: Metrics, bottlenecks, and optimization
- **Cluster Operations**: Scaling, maintenance, and troubleshooting

## üìö What is an Elasticsearch Cluster?

An Elasticsearch cluster is a collection of one or more nodes (servers) that together hold your entire data and provide federated indexing and search capabilities across all nodes.

### Key Concepts

- **Cluster**: A collection of nodes identified by a unique cluster name
- **Node**: A single server that stores data and participates in indexing/searching
- **Shard**: A subset of an index that lives on a single node
- **Replica**: A copy of a shard for redundancy and performance

      "cluster.routing.allocation.disk.watermark.low": "85%"
    },
    "persistent": true
  }'
```

## üìñ Step-by-Step Learning Guide

### Step 1: Your First Cluster Check

```bash
# Check if everything is running
curl "http://localhost:8081/health"

# Get cluster overview
curl "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/cluster/overview"
```

**What you'll see:** Basic cluster information including name, status, node count, and shard distribution.

### Step 2: Understanding Health Status

```bash
# Get detailed health information
curl "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/cluster/health"
```

**Key insights:**

- **Green**: All shards allocated (rare in single-node setup)
- **Yellow**: Primary shards allocated, replicas unassigned (normal for single-node)
- **Red**: Some primary shards unallocated (needs attention)

### Step 3: Exploring Nodes

```bash
# Get all node information
curl "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/cluster/nodes"
```

**What to look for:**

- Node roles (master, data, ingest)
- JVM heap settings
- Operating system information
- Available processors

### Step 4: Creating Your First Index

```bash
# Create an index to see cluster changes
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:9200/my-learning-index" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "settings": {
      "number_of_shards": 2,
      "number_of_replicas": 1
    }
  }'

# Now check cluster health again
curl "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/cluster/health"
```

**Expected changes:**

- `active_primary_shards`: 2
- `unassigned_shards`: 2 (replicas can't be allocated in single-node)
- Status remains Yellow

### Step 5: Monitoring in Real-Time

```bash
# Stream health updates every 5 seconds
curl "http://localhost:8081/api/v1/cluster/monitor/health?interval=5s"
```

This is perfect for understanding how cluster metrics change over time.

## üéØ Common Scenarios Explained

### Scenario 1: Fresh Empty Cluster

- **Status**: Green (no indices = no unallocated shards)
- **Nodes**: 1
- **Active shards**: 0
- **What it means**: Perfect starting state

### Scenario 2: Single Node with Data

- **Status**: Yellow (replica shards can't be allocated)
- **Nodes**: 1
- **Active shards**: Number of primary shards
- **Unassigned shards**: Number of replica shards
- **What it means**: Normal for development, data is safe

### Scenario 3: Multi-Node Production

- **Status**: Green (all shards allocated)
- **Nodes**: Multiple
- **Active shards**: Primaries + replicas
- **Unassigned shards**: 0
- **What it means**: Healthy production cluster

## üìä Performance Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Watch

1. **Cluster Health Status**

   - Should be Green in production
   - Yellow acceptable for development
   - Red requires immediate attention

2. **Shard Allocation**

   - Unassigned shards indicate problems
   - Relocating shards show rebalancing
   - Even distribution across nodes

3. **Node Resources**

   - JVM heap usage (< 85%)
   - CPU utilization
   - Disk space and I/O
   - Network throughput

4. **Performance Counters**
   - Search latency
   - Indexing throughput
   - Query cache hit ratio
   - Thread pool queue sizes

## üí° Best Practices

1. **Monitor Health Regularly**: Set up automated health checks
2. **Understand Yellow Status**: Normal for single-node development
3. **Watch Resource Usage**: Keep heap usage below 85%
