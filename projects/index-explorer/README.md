## üìñ Step-by-Step Learning Guide

### Step 1: Understanding Write-Heavy Architecture

```bash
# Create your first write-optimized index
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:8082/api/v1/indices/my-text-corpus" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "settings": {
      "write_optimized": true,
      "expected_doc_size": "large",
      "ingestion_rate": "high"
    }
  }'
```

**What happens**: ES configures optimal settings for write throughput:

- Increased refresh interval
- Optimized merge policy
- Appropriate buffer sizes
- Write-friendly replica settings

### Step 2: Bulk Operations Mastery

```bash
# Import a large text corpus efficiently
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8082/api/v1/indices/my-text-corpus/import" \

  -d '{
    "source": "large-text-dataset.ndjson",
    "batch_size": 1000,
    "parallel_workers": 4
  }'
```

**Key insights**:

- **Batch size matters**: 1000-5000 docs per batch for text
- **Parallelization**: Multiple workers for maximum throughput
- **Memory management**: Proper batching prevents OOM errors
- **Error handling**: Robust retry mechanisms for failed batches

### Step 3: Performance Monitoring
